It's a book about the brilliant investor Naval Ravikant.

I began to read it at on Jun 28th.

Here some quotes.

> Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work.

> Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.

> Focus on the thing that you are really into.

> Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion.

> If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you on that.

> It's much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the "right" thing a long time ago.

> When you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you'll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you-go all-in and forget about the rest.

> If you don't own a piece of a business, you don't have a path towards financial freedom.

> Without ownership, when you're sleeping, you're not earning. When you're retired, you're not earning. When you're on vacation, you're not earning. And you can't earn nonlinearly.

> Forget rich versus poor, white-collar versus blue. It's now leveraged versus un-leveraged.

> You're never going to get rich renting out your time.

> With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.

> Knowledge workers function like athletes-train and sprint, then rest and reassess.

> If you're looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it's going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process.

> Earn with your mind, not your time.
